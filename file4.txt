To setup:
git clone ...

To start work on a feature:
git checkout master
git pull origin master //sync your master with the remote

Create a new branch on github for your new feature, call it new_feature
git checkout -b new_feature

make some changes...
git add <files>
git commit <commit msg>

git push origin new_feature

Then go to Github, open pull request to merge into master. Then approve pull request
to have it merged into master. Once merged, delete the branch. Once you're notified
that your change was approved, to start work on next feature,
git checkout master
git pull origin master
git branch -d new_feature
git remote prune origin
